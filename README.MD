### Krichat

Krichat (ScreamChat) - chatty app in which it is customary to shout of what is important for you.

#### How does it works.
Basically it's just a chat application.  
A messenger. Dialogs and chat rooms and so on.

But! there is a difference.  
Along with the regular messages, you can post the SCREAMING ones.  
They're BIG! And they are red!  

But you cannot shout all the day long.  
To keep your words valuable, there is a daily limit of screaming messages.

#### Deployment

They are covered in requirements.txt file.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
